A classic no-arbitrage assumption can bound the\r\nprice of an option in terms of its underlying asset, but the fair option\r\nprice is furthermore a function of the distribution of returns earned by\r\nthe underlying asset. Therefore, a unique option price can be predicted by\r\nmodeling a complete market vis-Ã -vis the underlying asset's risk.\r\n\r\nThere are several option pricing models on Wall Street but OptionSim uses\r\na simple binomial tree which can accurately compute the price of a complex\r\noption. The underlying assumption is that the price of an asset can be\r\napproximated as one of two states - proportionally up or proportionally down -\r\nper period. Given a long enough traversal period along a stochastic process\r\nmodeling this pattern of price changes, CRReurocall allows OptionSim to\r\nprice a simple European style option written on a non-dividend paying stock.\r\n\r\nWhen the model is run under test vector with K=0, we expect output ~S(0).\r\nThe CRR model converges to Black Scholes dependent on n. For example, with\r\nn=5000 outputs converge to the Black Scholes Formula up to 6 sigfigs.\r\n\r\nIterates for the price of a European call option by using the Cox,\r\nRoss, and Rubinstein model based on the following inputs:\r\n\r\nr - annual interest rate\r\n\r\nsigma - sigma\r\n\r\nK - K price\r\n\r\nS(0) - current T=0 price of the S\r\n\r\nT - time to maturity in years\r\n\r\nn - number of iterations\r\n","google":"UA-69818689-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
